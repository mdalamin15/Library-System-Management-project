# 📚 Library Management System – SQL Project

This project showcases a structured and practical application of SQL for managing a library system. It includes data manipulation, reporting, and analytical queries covering key operations such as book issuance, returns, member tracking, overdue reporting, and revenue analysis.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

The Library Management System is designed to handle essential tasks like:

- Managing books, members, branches, employees
- Tracking issued and returned books
- Identifying overdue records
- Calculating revenue and performance metrics
- Analyzing member and employee activity

This project simulates a real-world relational database setup and uses SQL to extract insights, maintain data integrity, and support decision-making in a library context.

## 🧱 Database Structure

The database consists of the following tables:

- `books` – Contains book information such as ISBN, title, category, author, publisher, rental price, and availability.
- `members` – Stores member details like ID, name, address, and registration date.
- `employees` – Tracks employee details and branch assignment.
- `branch` – Contains information about library branches and their managers.
- `issued` – Records all issued book transactions.
- `return_status` – Logs return events related to issued books.

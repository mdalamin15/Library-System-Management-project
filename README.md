# üìö Library Management System ‚Äì SQL Project

This project showcases a structured and practical application of SQL for managing a library system. It includes data manipulation, reporting, and analytical queries covering key operations such as book issuance, returns, member tracking, overdue reporting, and revenue analysis.

---

## üìÇ Project Overview

The Library Management System is designed to handle essential tasks like:

- Managing books, members, branches, employees
- Tracking issued and returned books
- Identifying overdue records
- Calculating revenue and performance metrics
- Analyzing member and employee activity

This project simulates a real-world relational database setup and uses SQL to extract insights, maintain data integrity, and support decision-making in a library context.

## üß± Database Structure

The database consists of the following tables:

- `books` ‚Äì Contains book information such as ISBN, title, category, author, publisher, rental price, and availability.
- `members` ‚Äì Stores member details like ID, name, address, and registration date.
- `employees` ‚Äì Tracks employee details and branch assignment.
- `branch` ‚Äì Contains information about library branches and their managers.
- `issued` ‚Äì Records all issued book transactions.
- `return_status` ‚Äì Logs return events related to issued books.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Tasks Covered

Here are key tasks and queries executed in the project:

1. **Add a new book record**
2. **Update member details**
3. **Delete issued records**
4. **List books issued by specific employees**
5. **Find members with multiple issued books**
6. **Create summary tables using CTAS**
7. **Filter books by category**
8. **Calculate total rental income by category**
9. **List members who registered in the last 180 days**
10. **Employee‚Äìbranch relationship report with manager mapping**
11. **Create a table for expensive books**
12. **List books not yet returned**
13. **Identify members with overdue books (30+ days)**
14. **Branch performance reporting with revenue and issue-return count**
15. **Top 3 employees by number of book issues processed**

## üìä Data Analysis & Insights

The project performs data analytics on:

- Rental trends by category  
- Overdue book tracking and member accountability  
- Revenue per branch  
- Branch performance comparison  
- Employee contribution analysis  
- Real-time status of book returns

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **SQL** (PostgreSQL/MySQL compatible syntax)
- **Relational database design**
- **Data cleaning and joins**
- **Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT)**
- **Subqueries and CTAS (Create Table As Select)**

## üìÅ How to Use

1. Create the schema based on table structures.
2. Insert data if not pre-populated.
3. Run the SQL queries in the order provided for each task.
4. Review the outputs for reports and insights.
